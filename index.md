# Getting Started
Getting started with is-a-good.dev is easy! 

- [Fork](https://github.com/is-a-good-dev/register/fork) the registration repository. 
- Create a new file under the `sub-logs` directory.
  - Name the file according to the sub-domain name that you would like, for example `will.json`.

    *The file path and name should look somewhat similar to this: `sub-logs/will.json`*
- Read the format documentation [here](format.md) to see what json format you should be following.
- Check over your file to make sure that everything looks right and matches the format.
- Open your pull request.
- Check up on your pull request. Sometimes we will comment or add a new label, these can mean that you domain is unavailable or something is wrong with the file. If this is the case, don't worry! You are still able to get a domain, but you may have to either change the file name or check over the file again.
- Leave the rest down to us, we will make sure that the subdomain is sorted out.
- Once your pull request has been merged, enjoy the subdomain. If you ever need to change the subdomain, don't hesitate to open a new pull request to change any of the details.
